# TASK 1 â€“ Rule-Based Chatbot

This project features **Kitty**, a basic rule-based chatbot built using Python.  
Designed for simple conversational interactions, the chatbot demonstrates how conditional logic and pattern matching can be used to simulate intelligent dialogue.  
It responds to greetings, jokes, motivational quotes, time queries, and more, which helps explore fundamental AI and NLP concepts.
